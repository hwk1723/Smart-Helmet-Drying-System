Uses the Bonezegei_HCSR04 Arduino Library for Ultrasonic Distance Sensor by Bonezegei

HCSR04 Ultrasonic Sensor is placed in the middle of the HUCK Fan. Average distance from the sensor to the inner-top of the helmet is approximately 20cm. 

Counter will count for 5 * 2 seconds to prevent false readings.

Fan will only start again once helmet is removed and placed back onto it.
